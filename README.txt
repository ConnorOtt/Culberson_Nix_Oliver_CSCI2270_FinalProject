This project is the work of Chuck Culberson, Hayden Nix, and Alexander Oliver.

This project is for our CSCI 2270 class in order to use our C++ skills to bring together a functional project.

In brainstorming, we have come up with:
	1. Casual game with mechanics resembling 2048.
	2. Purely storage related program that has similarities to previous assignments/storage.
		-Game storage
		-Athletic Training App
		-Homework Scheduling
	3. Puzzle game idea.


And our decision of a project is:

	Hangman & Mastermind

And this is what it is in detail:
	
	Get inside the mind of this computer as you try to figure out not only what word or phrase is going through its circuits, but also the 4 part randomly generated color password to get its prize.
